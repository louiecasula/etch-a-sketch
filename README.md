# Etch-a-Sketch

As part of the Foundations Course in The Odin Project, this assignment is simply to create an etch-a-sketch. 
The [specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) are to create a grid using flexbox, with adjustable dimensions and squares that can be colored in,
 extra credit for having a rainbow and darkening option, which are present in my rendition of the classic kid's toy.
This was a great experience for gaining a better understanding of DOM element manipulation, flexbox display, and two dimensional arrays.
